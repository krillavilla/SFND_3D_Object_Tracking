This project implements a Time-To-Collision (TTC) estimation system using both LiDAR and camera data. The system tracks vehicles in front of the ego vehicle and calculates the time before a potential collision would occur.

## FP.0: Implementation Details

Here's a summary of the implemented components and their locations:

| Task | File | Line Numbers |
|------|------|-------------|
| FP.1: Match Bounding Boxes | src/camFusion_Student.cpp | 160-239 |
| FP.2: Compute Lidar-based TTC | src/camFusion_Student.cpp | 153-207 |
| FP.3: Associate Keypoint Matches with ROI | src/camFusion_Student.cpp | 139-186 |
| FP.4: Compute Camera-based TTC | src/camFusion_Student.cpp | 189-263 |

## Implementation Approach

### FP.1: Match Bounding Boxes

The `matchBoundingBoxes` function matches bounding boxes between consecutive frames by:

1. Iterating through all keypoint matches between frames
2. Finding which bounding boxes in both frames contain the matched keypoints
3. Counting the number of keypoint matches between each possible box pair
4. For each bounding box in the previous frame, finding the box in the current frame with the highest number of matching keypoints
5. Storing these best matches in the `bbBestMatches` map

### FP.2: Compute Lidar-based TTC

The `computeTTCLidar` function calculates TTC using LiDAR points by:

1. Sorting LiDAR points by x-coordinate (distance from the sensor)
2. Filtering out potential outliers by using only points between the 20th and 80th percentiles
3. Computing the mean x-distance for the filtered points in both frames
4. Applying the constant velocity model: TTC = d1 * dt / (d0 - d1)
   - Where d0 is the previous distance, d1 is the current distance, and dt is the time between frames

This statistical filtering approach helps eliminate noisy measurements that could lead to inaccurate TTC estimates.

### FP.3: Associate Keypoint Matches with Bounding Boxes

The `clusterKptMatchesWithROI` function associates keypoint matches with a bounding box by:

1. Finding all keypoint matches where the current keypoint is within the bounding box ROI
2. Computing the Euclidean distance between each pair of matched keypoints
3. Calculating the mean distance across all matches
4. Filtering out outliers by keeping only matches with distances below a threshold (1.5 times the mean)
5. Adding the filtered matches to the bounding box's `kptMatches` vector

### FP.4: Compute Camera-based TTC

The `computeTTCCamera` function calculates TTC using camera data by:

1. Computing distance ratios between all pairs of matched keypoints
2. Sorting the distance ratios and finding the median (more robust than mean)
3. Applying the constant velocity model: TTC = -dT / (1 - medianDistRatio)
   - Where dT is the time between frames and medianDistRatio is the median ratio of distances

Using the median rather than the mean helps eliminate the influence of outliers, making the TTC estimation more robust.
